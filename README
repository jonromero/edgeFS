This idea behind EdgeFS is that it is a very simple filesystem (less than 100 lines of Python),
trivial to implement in other languages, trivial to read and understand.

You start an Edge in your laptop/desktop and you can connect to either your Edges that store your files
or connect to open edges you can find at EdgeFS.com. 

You can download files from Edges, upload files (broken down to small encrypted parts) to other Edges
and query all the files that exist in your connected Edge Universe.

I imagine specific groups can be created (scientificpapers.edgefs.com) where you can query and download papers.

Also index.edgefs.com can be created so EdgeFS can always be online.
